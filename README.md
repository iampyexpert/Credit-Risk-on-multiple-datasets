This project is based on Credit-Risk predictions using advance machine learning with multiple datasets

Machine Learning Models
This project evaluates the performance of four machine learning models for credit risk assessment:

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and robustness. It is known for handling diverse data types and providing reliable predictions.

Gradient Boosting: An iterative model that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting errors from the previous one. It excels in capturing complex patterns and offers a balance between accuracy and interpretability.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in the feature space. It is effective in classification tasks but may require extensive parameter tuning.

Neural Networks: Deep learning models that can model complex, non-linear relationships in data. They excel in capturing intricate patterns and interactions, making them highly effective for datasets with high dimensionality.

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to determine the most effective approach for predicting borrower defaults.
